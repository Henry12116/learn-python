# variables let you store information, they can contain whatever you want

# for example
booba = "(.) (.)"

# in this case, we have created a variable called booba, and we have set it equal to a string that looks like some boobs
# we can access this variable in other parts of our program... let's try it out

# this will print the boobs... nice
print(booba)

# variables don't have to be equal to strings, again they can be whatever you want
# lets overwrite booba to be something else
booba = 1337

# this will print the number 1337
print(booba)

# you can combine variables together using operators (like a calculator)
numOne = 1

# this will print 1338
print(booba + numOne)


# you can name a variable what ever you want, however there are some naming rules you must follow
# 1. variables must start with a lowercase letter
# 2. variables cannot contain spaces or other special characters
# 3. when naming variables, people either use camel case (thisIsCamelCase) or snake case (this_is_snake_case)
#   - I dont care which one you use, just be consistet in your code (dont start using snake case if you've been using camel case)
